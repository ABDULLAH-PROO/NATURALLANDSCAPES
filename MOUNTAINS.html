           <u> Mountains are large, tall landforms that stick out from the earth. They're like nature's skyscrapers, with steep sides and high peaks. Mountains form in different ways, like when the earth's plates push against each other or when volcanoes erupt.

            They're not just big rocks; mountains affect the weather and create special habitats for plants and animals. People love mountains for their beauty and adventure. You can climb them, hike through them, or just admire them from afar.

            But mountains need our help too. They face problems like deforestation and climate change. Protecting mountains is important to keep them beautiful and to take care of the creatures that call them home.

            In short, mountains are amazing natural wonders that deserve our respect and protection.</u>
